# Deep Reinforcement Learning Gym From Scratch

## Overview

This project is a Python-based implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Gym, utilizing TensorFlow for neural network computations. It's designed to demonstrate the principles of Deep Q-Learning by training an AI agent to navigate a grid environment towards a specified goal.
